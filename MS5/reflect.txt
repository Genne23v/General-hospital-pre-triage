The final project is the total set of what we have learned throughout the semester. It’s multiple hierarchy inheritance to see how abstract class and virtual functions work together. Through numerous errors and trials, I spent a lot of time watching how they work. I think I have a better understanding of polymorphism and inheritance, but I still feel I have a long way to go to get comfortable with this. And understanding how const works is important too. I should keep that in mind how it affects declaration and how to use parameter all the time. It was very hard to find the root cause of the error at the beginning. And file input and output is also important along with different behaviors of char pointer and string and how to convert one into the other. As I’m using more and more libraries, I feel that I need to get used to those libraries as well. I still have to find out right syntax for library functions most of time. I think it will greatly improve my efficiency later on. As I learn more and more concepts and rules of the language, I feel the need that I need to make my own references and cheatsheet for ones that I look up constantly. Good thing is that I have enjoyed workshops and project although sometimes, it’s real tedious and frustrating. Thank you for the learning!
